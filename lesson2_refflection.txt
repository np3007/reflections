What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
When you initialise the repository a .git file is created in your repository but the files in the directory are not yet commited to the git repository


CREATING A GIT REPOSITORY FROM SCRATCH:
git init

git status gives you the status of the untracked files in your pwd as well as the added files in your staging area

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Staging area is where the files that are to go as part of one commit go. So "git add file1" command adds the file1 to staging area
