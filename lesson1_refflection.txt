How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
It helped me see!
How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
you know right!
How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
Git log is to see the list of all commits, git diff can be used to take a difference between two commits using the ids listed in git log.

When you checkout in Git, you checkout the entire commit. Also, you go into 'detatched HEAD' state because yuo can actually create a new branch starting from the current checked-out commit view. If you want to start a new branch you can do so using:
git checkout -b new_branch

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
gives me the ability to revert to an older version whenever i want and to compare and find out where the bug was introduced.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
